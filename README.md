# week3PasswordGenerator

In this weeks challenege we are to creat a password generator using Java Srcipt. 
This task called for the use of random passwords to be generated upon the users request. 

in this task i created a alreat box that as for the number of charatcers that the user wishes to have in the password along with numbers and symbols. This was no
easy task and this is still a working task. I have gotten to the part of the alreat box being able to function but making sure that the for loop is place so tha
passwords and be ever going.
